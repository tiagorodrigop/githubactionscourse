            # For work-in-progress PRs you can typically use draft pull requests
            # from GitHub. However, private repositories on the free plan don't have
            # this option and therefore this action allows you to opt-in to using the
            # special "[WIP]" prefix to indicate this state. This will avoid the
            # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.
            # Note that a second check will be reported if this is enabled.
